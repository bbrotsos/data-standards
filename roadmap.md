title: Acreage Crop Reporting Roadmap
---

The Department of Agriculture plans on allowing 3rd party developers to submit data for Acreage
Reporting. These are the __proposed__ data elements and schemas for Acreage Reporting to USDA, and no production development should currently be done based on standards here.     

The goal is to get feedback as early on as possible, so please [contribute feedback](../contribute.html).  The Roadmap and timelines will be updated here when it becomes available.
