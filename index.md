This is the official site for distributing common USDA Data Standards for Food, Farms and Forests data elements. 

![USDA Future State Diagram:  This shows the relationship between USDA Customers, USDA Programs, Statistical Agencies and Open Data.  An ideal future state has common elements to make sharing data more efficient.](Common_Elements.png)

The first subdomain is in support of USDA's <a href="about-acrsi.html">Acreage and Crop Reporting and Streamline Initiative (ACRSI) project</a> which 
has standard data elements and data specification that can be viewed <a href="data-elements/index.html">here</a>.

USDA is following the best practices and guidances from
the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) in establishing this emerging domain.

USDA has also set this page up for collaboration and USDA welcomes your feedback in ensuring
we create complete, full-described standards for interfacing with USDA.

This collaboration site is intended:  

* USDA program managers  
* Business analysts  
* Developers  
* US Federal Agencies  
* Members of the public  
* Industry Partners
