USDA ACRSI IEPD Schema definition 1.0
=====================================
Acreage Crop Reporting and Streamlining Initiative (ACRSI) is a project sponsored by the Deputy Undersecretary of Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services and the Department of Agriculture Chief Information Officer.

The vision of the USDA ACRSI is to “have a common USDA framework for producer commodity reporting in support of USDA programs”.  This common framework will enable producers to report common data. The ACRSI project objective is to streamline the acreage reporting process for producers across USDA. The initiative is to simplify reporting processes, dates, data definitions, and develop data standards for commodities and associated data. The intention is to reduce the burden on the producer to participate in USDA programs while simultaneously improving program integrity and data sharing across USDA agencies.
